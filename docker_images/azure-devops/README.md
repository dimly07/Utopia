# Azure DevOps Build Agents

This mini project is used to build self-hosted build agents in Azure DevOps with a few tools installed and configured. This can be used to replace the Azure provided build agents allowing you to run the build agent on your network with a low cost resource like Azure Container Insights or in an existing cluster.
